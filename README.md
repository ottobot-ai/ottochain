## What is Workchain?

Workchain is a metagraph built on the Constellation Network that enables:

- **JSON-Encoded State Machines** - Define complex workflows without writing code
- **Script Oracles** - Deterministic, stateful computation using JSON Logic
- **Multi-Party Coordination** - Atomic cross-machine transactions and triggers
- **AI-Friendly** - LLMs can generate and understand JSON Logic natively

## Features

✅ State machines with guards, effects, and transitions
✅ Script oracles with stateful JSON Logic programs
✅ Cross-machine dependencies and triggers
✅ Parent-child hierarchies and spawning
✅ Structured outputs and event logging
✅ Gas metering and cycle detection
