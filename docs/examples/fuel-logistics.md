## Overview

The Fuel Logistics example models a complete fuel delivery contract lifecycle with:

- **4 interconnected state machines** coordinating the entire workflow
- **Multi-stage approval process** (supplier verification → contract approval → quality inspection)
- **GPS tracking window** that is activated only during transit phase
- **Cross-machine dependencies** ensuring proper sequencing of operations
- **Quality gates** at critical checkpoints (supplier compliance, fuel quality)
- **Automated settlement** upon successful completion

### Key Economic Flow

```
Draft Contract → Supplier Review → GPS Activation → Transit (GPS Tracking Active) →
Delivery → Quality Inspection → Settlement
```

## State Machines

### 1. Fuel Contract State Machine

**Purpose**: Main contract managing the complete lifecycle from draft through settlement.

**States**: 11 total states
- `draft` - Initial contract creation
- `supplier_review` - Awaiting supplier approval
- `supplier_approved` - Supplier verified and approved
- `gps_ready` - GPS activated, shipment prepared
- `in_transit` - Active delivery (GPS tracking window) 🌟
- `delivered` - Fuel delivered, GPS tracking stopped
- `quality_check` - Quality inspection in progress
- `inspected` - Quality inspection passed
- `settling` - Payment processing
- `settled` - Contract completed (final state)
- `rejected` - Quality inspection failed (final state)

#### State Diagram

![Fuel Contract State Machine](../../diagrams/fuel_contract_states.png)

Source: `diagrams/fuel_contract_states.dot`

#### Key Features

**Multi-Stage Approval**:
```
draft → supplier_review → supplier_approved → gps_ready → in_transit
```

**GPS Tracking Window** 🌟:
- Contract can only enter `in_transit` if GPS is actively tracking
- Contract can only exit to `delivered` if GPS has stopped and has ≥3 data points
- Enforces GPS tracking throughout delivery

**Quality Gate**:
```
quality_check → inspected (if quality ≥ 85)
quality_check → rejected (if quality < 85 OR contamination detected)
```

**Cross-Machine Dependencies**:
- `supplier_approved` transition requires: `SupplierApproval.status === "approved"`
- `gps_ready` transition requires: `GPSTracker.status === "active"`
- `in_transit` transition requires: `GPSTracker.status === "tracking"` AND `dataPointCount > 0`
- `delivered` transition requires: `GPSTracker.status === "stopped"` AND `dataPointCount ≥ 3`
- `quality_check` transition requires: `QualityInspection.status === "scheduled"`
- `inspected` transition requires: `QualityInspection.status === "passed"` AND `qualityScore ≥ 85`

**Computed Fields**:
- `totalAmount = fuelQuantity * pricePerLiter` (calculated during settlement)
- Captures GPS metrics: `totalDistance`, `gpsDataPoints` from tracker

#### State Details

| State | Purpose | Entry Requirements | Key Data Captured |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `draft` | Initial state | None | contractId, buyer, fuelType, quantity, price |
| `supplier_review` | Supplier vetting | quantity ≥ 1000 | submittedAt |
| `supplier_approved` | Supplier verified | Supplier.status = "approved" | approvedSupplier, supplierApprovedAt |
| `gps_ready` | Shipment prepared | GPS.status = "active" | vehicleId, driverId, shipmentPreparedAt |
| `in_transit` | Active delivery | GPS.status = "tracking", dataPoints > 0 | transitStartedAt, estimatedArrival |
| `delivered` | Delivery complete | GPS.status = "stopped", dataPoints ≥ 3 | deliveredAt, totalDistance, gpsDataPoints |
| `quality_check` | Inspection initiated | Inspection.status = "scheduled" | inspectionInitiatedAt |
| `inspected` | Quality verified | Inspection passed, quality ≥ 85 | inspectedAt, qualityScore, qualityReport |
| `settling` | Payment processing | Previous state inspected | settlementInitiatedAt, totalAmount |
| `settled` | **Final state** | Payment confirmed | settledAt, paymentConfirmation |
| `rejected` | **Final state** | Quality failed | rejectedAt, rejectionReason, qualityScore |

### 2. GPS Tracker State Machine

**Purpose**: Tracks vehicle location during fuel delivery, logs GPS coordinates.

**States**: 5 total states
- `inactive` - Tracker not assigned
- `active` - Tracker activated for vehicle
- `tracking` - Actively logging GPS positions 🌟
- `stopped` - Tracking complete
- `archived` - Data archived (final state)

#### State Diagram

![GPS Tracker State Machine](../../diagrams/gps_tracker_states.png)

Source: `diagrams/gps_tracker_states.dot`

#### Key Features

**Position Logging** 🌟:
- `tracking → tracking` self-transition on `log_position` event
- Updates latitude, longitude, timestamp
- Increments `dataPointCount`
- Accumulates `totalDistance` with each position update

**Data Integrity**:
- Cannot stop tracking until at least 1 data point logged
- Limits to 100 data points maximum (prevents unbounded growth)
- Preserves origin coordinates (`originLat`, `originLon`)
- Records final position (`finalLat`, `finalLon`)

**Lifecycle**:
```
inactive → active → tracking → [log_position × N] → stopped → archived
```

#### State Details

| State | Purpose | Transitions | Key Data |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| `inactive` | Initial state | activate | trackerId |
| `active` | Ready to track | start_tracking | vehicleId, activatedAt, dataPointCount=0 |
| `tracking` | Logging positions | log_position (self), stop_tracking | lat/lon, dataPointCount, totalDistance |
| `stopped` | Tracking complete | archive | stoppedAt, finalLat, finalLon |
| `archived` | **Final state** | None | archivedAt |

**Self-Transition Effect** (tracking → tracking):
```javascript
effect: [
  ["lastLat", event.latitude],
  ["lastLon", event.longitude],
  ["lastUpdate", event.timestamp],
  ["dataPointCount", state.dataPointCount + 1],
  ["totalDistance", state.totalDistance + event.distanceDelta]
]
```

### 3. Supplier Approval State Machine

**Purpose**: Vets fuel supplier for compliance and licensing before contract approval.

**States**: 4 total states
- `pending` - Awaiting review
- `reviewing` - Under compliance assessment
- `approved` - Supplier verified (non-final, can be referenced)
- `rejected` - Supplier failed verification (final state)

#### State Diagram

![Supplier Approval State Machine](../../diagrams/supplier_approval_states.png)

Source: `diagrams/supplier_approval_states.dot`

#### Key Features

**Multiple Guards on Same Event** 🌟:
The `approve` event from `reviewing` state has two possible outcomes:
- → `approved` if `complianceScore ≥ 75` AND `licenseValid === true`
- → `rejected` if `complianceScore < 75` OR `licenseValid === false`

**Non-Final Approval State**:
- `approved` is NOT a final state (unlike typical approval patterns)
- Allows contract to reference `Supplier.status === "approved"` later
- Enables continued monitoring or audit operations

#### State Details

| State | Purpose | Transitions |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `pending` | Initial state | begin_review |
| `reviewing` | Compliance check | approve (with guards) |
| `approved` | Verified supplier | (non-final) |
| `rejected` | **Final state** | None |

**Approval Criteria**:
- Compliance score ≥ 75 (0-100 scale)
- Valid operating license
- Both conditions must be true for approval

---

### 4. Quality Inspection State Machine

**Purpose**: Post-delivery quality verification of fuel shipment.

**States**: 5 total states
- `pending` - Awaiting scheduling
- `scheduled` - Inspector assigned
- `inspecting` - Active quality assessment
- `passed` - Quality verified (final state)
- `failed` - Quality rejected (final state)

#### State Diagram

![Quality Inspection State Machine](../../diagrams/quality_inspection_states.png)

Source: `diagrams/quality_inspection_states.dot`

#### Key Features

**Multiple Guards on Same Event** 🌟:
The `complete` event from `inspecting` state has two possible outcomes:
- → `passed` if `qualityScore ≥ 85` AND `contaminationDetected === false`
- → `failed` if `qualityScore < 85` OR `contaminationDetected === true`

**Contract Integration**:
- Contract cannot proceed to `inspected` unless inspection is `passed`
- Failed inspection triggers contract `rejected` state
- Quality score propagated to contract state

#### State Details

| State | Purpose | Quality Criteria |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| `pending` | Initial state | - |
| `scheduled` | Inspector assigned | - |
| `inspecting` | Testing in progress | - |
| `passed` | **Final state** | Quality ≥ 85, no contamination |
| `failed` | **Final state** | Quality < 85 OR contamination |

**Quality Metrics**:
- Quality score: 0-100 scale (85 minimum for pass)
- Contamination detection: boolean test
- Report ID generated for passed inspections

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. GPS Tracking Window 🌟

**Pattern**: Time-bound monitoring activated only during specific contract phase

The contract enforces GPS tracking exclusively during transit:

**Activation Requirements**:
- Contract → `gps_ready`: Requires GPS in `active` state
- Contract → `in_transit`: Requires GPS in `tracking` state with data points logged

**Deactivation Requirements**:
- Contract → `delivered`: Requires GPS in `stopped` state with ≥3 data points

**Data Capture**:
- Contract captures GPS metrics upon delivery: `totalDistance`, `gpsDataPoints`
- Provides immutable proof of delivery route

### 2. Self-Transition with State Updates

**Pattern**: Same-state transition that accumulates data

GPS Tracker's `log_position` event:
```
tracking --[log_position]--> tracking
```

Each invocation:
- Updates `lastLat`, `lastLon`, `lastUpdate`
- Increments `dataPointCount`
- Accumulates `totalDistance`

Demonstrates incremental state mutation without state change.

### 3. Multiple Guards on Same Event

**Pattern**: Event fan-out based on complex conditions

**Supplier Approval** (`approve` event):
```
reviewing --[approve]--> approved   (if compliance ≥ 75 AND license valid)
reviewing --[approve]--> rejected   (if compliance < 75 OR license invalid)
```

**Quality Inspection** (`complete` event):
```
inspecting --[complete]--> passed   (if quality ≥ 85 AND no contamination)
inspecting --[complete]--> failed   (if quality < 75 OR contamination)
```

Single event, multiple outcomes based on payload data.

### 4. Cross-Machine Dependencies with Data Extraction

**Pattern**: State transitions gated by other machines' state AND data

Contract extracts data from dependency machines:

```javascript
// From SupplierApproval
"approvedSupplier": machines.${supplierCid}.state.supplierName

// From GPSTracker
"totalDistance": machines.${gpsTrackerCid}.state.totalDistance
"gpsDataPoints": machines.${gpsTrackerCid}.state.dataPointCount

// From QualityInspection
"qualityScore": machines.${inspectionCid}.state.qualityScore
"qualityReport": machines.${inspectionCid}.state.reportId
```

Demonstrates rich cross-machine data flow.

### 5. Computed Fields in Effects

**Pattern**: Dynamic calculation during state transition

Settlement calculation:
```javascript
"totalAmount": {
  "*": [
    { "var": "state.fuelQuantity" },
    { "var": "state.pricePerLiter" }
  ]
}
```

Example: 5000 liters × $2/liter = $10,000 total

### 6. Multi-Stage Approval Workflow

**Pattern**: Sequential validation gates

```
Draft → Supplier Review → GPS Ready → In Transit → Quality Check → Settlement
```

Each stage gates the next:
1. Supplier must be approved before GPS activation
2. GPS must be active before shipment preparation
3. GPS must be tracking before transit
4. GPS must be stopped before delivery confirmation
5. Quality must pass before settlement

### 7. Non-Final Approval States

**Pattern**: Approval states that remain queryable

`SupplierApproval.approved` is NOT a final state:
- Allows contract to check `Supplier.status === "approved"` later
- Could support re-verification or audit workflows
- Demonstrates stateful approval tracking

## Conclusion

The Fuel Logistics example demonstrates that the `DeterministicEventProcessor` infrastructure supports:

✅ **GPS tracking window** activated only during specific contract phases
✅ **Self-transitions** for incremental data accumulation (position logging)
✅ **Multiple guards** on single events for complex decision logic
✅ **Cross-machine dependencies** with data extraction (6 dependency checks)
✅ **Computed fields** for dynamic calculations (settlement amount)
✅ **Multi-stage approvals** with sequential validation gates
✅ **Non-final approval states** for continued monitoring
✅ **Final state fan-out** for success/failure paths

The JSON-encoded approach enables this complex logistics workflow to be defined, tested, and deployed without writing custom state machine code for each entity type. The workflow demonstrates patterns applicable to real-world supply chain, transportation, and delivery verification systems.
