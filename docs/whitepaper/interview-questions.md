# OttoChain Whitepaper Interview Questions

*Generated 2026-02-12 — Use these to extract mission, vision, and values for whitepaper refinement*

---

## Part 1: The "Why" — Mission & Purpose

### 1. Origin Story
- What moment or problem made you think "I need to build this"?
- Was there a specific frustration with existing systems that sparked OttoChain?

### 2. The Core Problem
- If you had to explain OttoChain's purpose to a non-technical friend in 30 seconds, what would you say?
- Is OttoChain primarily solving a *trust* problem, a *coordination* problem, or something else?

### 3. Who Feels the Pain?
- Who wakes up frustrated that OttoChain doesn't exist yet?
- Is the primary user an AI agent, its operator, or the humans who interact with agents?

### 4. Why Now?
- What's changed in the world that makes OttoChain timely? (AI explosion? Platform lock-in? Agent economy emergence?)
- Could this have worked 5 years ago? Why or why not?

## Part 2: The Vision — Where This Goes

### 5. Success in 5 Years
- Paint the picture: it's 2031, OttoChain succeeded. What does the world look like?
- What headlines do you want to read about OttoChain?

### 6. The Ultimate Goal
- Is OttoChain meant to be *infrastructure* (invisible plumbing) or a *platform* (visible ecosystem)?
- Do you want "OttoChain" to be a household name, or for people to use it without knowing?

### 7. Scope Boundaries
- The whitepaper covers identity, reputation, contracts, markets, governance, corporate... What's the *core* that everything else serves?
- If you could only ship ONE thing perfectly, what would it be?

### 8. The Agent Future
- Do you believe agents will primarily serve humans, collaborate with each other, or operate autonomously?
- How does OttoChain's design reflect your beliefs about AI's role in society?

---

## Part 3: Values & Principles

### 9. Non-Negotiables
- What principles would you refuse to compromise, even if it cost users or growth?
- The whitepaper mentions decentralization — is that a *value* or a *means to an end*?

### 10. Trade-off Priorities
Rank these when they conflict:
- Security vs. speed
- Decentralization vs. usability
- Agent autonomy vs. human oversight
- Simplicity vs. flexibility
- Early adoption vs. long-term correctness

### 11. What OttoChain Is NOT
- What's the most common misconception you expect people to have?
- What should OttoChain explicitly *not* be used for?

### 12. Open vs. Controlled
- Should anyone be able to deploy any state machine, or should some require approval?
- How do you balance permissionless innovation with preventing abuse?

---

## Part 4: Technical Philosophy

### 13. JSON Logic Choice
- The whitepaper calls JSON Logic "AI-native." Is this a technical convenience or a philosophical position about how AI should interact with systems?
- What do you lose by choosing JSON Logic over a more expressive language?

### 14. Constellation Network
- Why Constellation specifically? What would make you reconsider?
- Is OttoChain portable to other networks, or is it deeply tied to Tessellation's model?

### 15. Two-Token Model
- The OTTO/STAKE split is complex. Is this essential to the vision, or an economic experiment?
- If you could simplify to one token, would you?

---

## Part 5: Community & Adoption

### 16. First Users
- Who should be the first 10 users of OttoChain? The first 100?
- What's the smallest viable community that could sustain the ecosystem?

### 17. Developer Experience
- The docs emphasize "zero-code deployment." Is the target user a developer, a business user, or an AI agent itself?
- What should feel *magical* about using OttoChain?

### 18. Network Effects
- How does OttoChain become more valuable as more people use it?
- What's the "cold start" problem and how do you solve it?

---

## Part 6: Positioning & Narrative

### 19. Competition Framing
- The whitepaper compares to Ethereum, DIDs, OAuth. But who's the *real* competition?
- Is OttoChain competing with platforms (Discord, OpenAI) or protocols (ENS, Ceramic)?

### 20. The Elevator Pitch
- Complete this sentence: "OttoChain is the _____ for _____."
- What mental model should people use? (Is it like DNS? Like LinkedIn? Like a credit score?)

### 21. The Skeptic's Question
- What's the strongest argument *against* OttoChain, and how would you respond?
- Why would someone choose NOT to use OttoChain?

---

## Part 7: The Human Element

### 22. Accountability
- Who's responsible when an agent with a good reputation does something harmful?
- Does OttoChain shift trust to code, or does it still require human judgment somewhere?

### 23. Power Distribution
- The reputation system creates tiers (Newcomer → Elder). Is hierarchy desirable or a necessary evil?
- How do you prevent reputation from becoming a new form of gatekeeping?

### 24. Failure Modes
- What happens if OttoChain succeeds but creates unintended consequences?
- What guardrails exist against a "reputation dystopia"?

---

## Part 8: Personal Investment

### 25. Skin in the Game
- What are you personally betting by building OttoChain?
- What would make you consider this project a failure even if it's technically successful?

### 26. The Legacy Question
- If OttoChain is remembered for one contribution to the world, what should it be?
- What do you want to be true about how AI agents operate in 20 years because OttoChain existed?

## After Answering

Once you've worked through these, we can:
1. Synthesize answers into a **Mission Statement** (1 paragraph)
2. Draft a **Vision Statement** (where we're going)
3. Distill **Core Values** (3-5 principles)
4. Rewrite the whitepaper intro to lead with "why" before "how"
